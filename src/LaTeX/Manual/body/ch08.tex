In this chapter, the writer of Code Beautifier Collection wants to express his big thanks to all the people that guide him for so long. Yes, he owes them so much.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Borland/CodeGear should be praised for giving birth to Delphi and
continuing it for more than ten years. Thanks to everyone in the R\&D department, left and remaining.
\item This expert (no matter which version it is) cannot be born if \index{David Hervieux}David Hervieux had not released his expert, ''Sharp Builder Tools''. Thanks for permitting me to use your files.
\item Thank JCF and AStyle. Without the two of you, I don't know how I've beautified/formatted my files in these years.
\end{enumerate}

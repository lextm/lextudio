\item [Homepage]

I moved the homepage of CBC to Google Code.
\hyperlink{http://code.google.com/p/lextudio}

Old versions of CBC are available here.

\item [E-Mail]

Please feel free to email to me.

I would reply as soon as possible (But rarely I like to enjoy holidays without
connection to the Internet, so may reply to you after weeks).

The email address is now \hyperlink{lextudio@gmail.com}

The title should be beginning with ''[CBC v*.*]'' (*.* stands for the version you use).

\item [Blog]
The news of CBC is published on my personal blog.

Easily leave a message/comment there can let me see your precious word.

The link is
\hyperlink{
http://lextm.blogspot.com

\begin{flushleft}
WHY you had better contact me? You should let me know that you use CBC in order to inspire me to keep updating it. WITHOUT YOU CBC may not be quickly evolved.

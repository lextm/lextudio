The author is an interesting Chinese guy named Li, Yang (sounds like Lee
Young), who is now Software Engineer in Scientific Atlanta, A Cisco Company
(Shanghai). He maintains this Code Beautifier Collection project in his spare
time.

He started programming in 2002 and mastered Delphi and C\#. He uses
C/\-C++ languages, too. Being passionate and curious, he is eager to learn new
technologies.

Being a crazy of western pop music, he likes to sing nearly every minute.
Backstreet Boys, Boyzone, and Westlife are his favourite bands. However, he is
very quiet when he works on the new novels in the evening.

He is still unmarried and lives with his parents.

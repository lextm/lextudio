If you're not a user of CodeGear RAD Studio, I'm
sorry that you cannot enjoy the happiness CBC 6 brings. But there are STILL tips
for you to make you enjoy the joy of a good code beautifier that meets your need. They are all free but not all open source.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If Borland Developer Studio (BDS 1.0 - 4.0) is your IDE, you can
  download CBC 5.3.3 from the old homepage,
  \hyperlink{http://gforge.oss.org.cn/projects/codebeautifiers}
\item If you're searching for experts to integrate in Borland Delphi 5/6/7\index{Delphi 5/6/7}, you can find them on JEDI Code Format website.
\hyperlink{
http://jedicodeformat.sourceforge.net/
}

\item Borland C++Builder 5/6\index{BCB} users may try C++ Formatting Expert (I hadn't tried it and I don't know whether it supports older version of BCB).

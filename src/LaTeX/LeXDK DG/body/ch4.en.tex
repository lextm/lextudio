\begin{itemize}
\item Lextm.Common is under LGPL. It contains basic classes for Lextm's daily
work.
\item BeWise.SharpBuilderTools.Minus contains classes taken from SBT.
\item Lextm.LeXDK.Core contains classes for plus design, and part of it under
BeWise namespace is ported from SBT.
\end{itemize}

Lextm.CodeBeautifierCollection.Framework provides Galileo IDE an entry to load
LeXDK and all valid Pluses.

The classes and functions of LeXDK are detailed in ClassReference.chm. It is a
VS2005 style help file located in the doc folder.

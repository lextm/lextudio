<H2>What does it do?</H2>
<P>The formatter can standardise all aspects of Delphi Object Pascal =
source code=20
formatting, including indentation, spacing and capitalisation.&nbsp;If =
you are=20
still not sure, see <A=20
href=3D"http://jedicodeformat.sourceforge.net/examples.html">the =
examples of=20
program input and output</A> . </P>
<H2>Why use a code formater?</H2>
<P>It is useful if you are taking over code and don't like the original=20
formatting. It is useful if you are trying to bring code from multiple =
sources=20
to one standard.</P>
<P>A human <B>can</B> always produce better formatting than a program, =
but in=20
many cases they don't. If you find a piece of code's formatting annoying =
or hard=20
to read, this program can save you a lot of time.</P>
<P>On your own code it can catch your mistakes, and even automate some =
mundane=20
tasks that may have annoyed you but you haven't bothered with up to now =
(e.g. to=20
turn tabs to spaces, standardise&nbsp; indentation, spacing and =
capitalisation,=20
globally change a variable or procedure name, globally remove redundant =
unit=20
from all uses clauses, or even to insert the MPL licence comment into =
all=20
units).</P>
<H2>How should I format my Delphi programs?</H2>
<P>You should format your Delphi programs as per this program's default=20
settings, i.e. <A=20
href=3D"http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,10280,00.html">as =

you=20
improve this program in any way (bug fix, new feature, better algorithm, =

whatever), I would appreciate it if you send those improvements back to =
me for=20

<P><B>Disclaimer:</B> This program may have bugs or not yet fully meet =

with some=20
success, I cannot make any guarantees. If you care about the quality of =

<P>Things that can go wrong with compilation:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>&nbsp;The project TestProject.dpr is opened by default, and this =
project=20
  is full of warnings. Remember&nbsp; it is just test code for the =
formatter to=20
  work on, and is not intended to be run. Delphi opens the last project =
in a=20
  group automatically, and I wish Borland would change this. TestProject =
is the=20
  least important of the projects. Use the menu item&nbsp; =
<CODE>View|Project=20
  manager</CODE> and open the first project, JediCodeFormat.dpr instead. =

  <LI>Some files can't be found (you will get an error like =
"<CODE>[Fatal Error]=20
  JediCodeFormat.dpr(142): File not found: 'JclStrings.dcu'."</CODE> The =
JCF=20
  files and JediComponents files are not included in this zip file. You =
may have=20
  placed them&nbsp; in a different location on your hard drive. Change =
the paths=20
  in the <CODE>JediCodeFormat.dpr, Jcf.dpr and Jcfide.dpk </CODE>files.=20
  <LI>The files are marked read-only. This is the way that they come out =
of the=20
  source-control system. You may clear this setting.&nbsp;=20
  <LI>The <CODE>Output</CODE> directory is not found. I like to =
configure Delphi=20
  to write the <CODE>.dcu</CODE> files and executables to an output =
directory.=20
  Naturally, when distributing the source, this directory is empty. =
WinZip=20
  doesn't store empty directories, so it may not exist after you unzip.=20
  Sometimes I remember to put a dummy file called Delme.tmp in this =
directory.=20
  If you see that file, it has already served it's purpose and may be=20
  removed.&nbsp; Make an <CODE>Output</CODE> directory under your =
CodeFormat=20
  directory, or clear (or change) this setting in Delphi's=20
  <CODE>Project|Options|Directories/Conditionals</CODE> settings.=20
  <LI><CODE>Jdfide.dpk</CODE> gives a lot of warnings about implicly =
imported=20
  units. Yes it does. It's not serious.=20
  <LI>All projects except the first will not build at all becuase of =
files that=20
  are not found, and thse files are part of JCF. Make sure that you have =
an=20
  output directory, and that it contains the DCU files, and that it is =
on the=20
  project's search path.=20

as=20
  there is a litte bit of code behind&nbsp; $IFDEF macros to make the =
IDE=20

is not=20

<H2>What to do if you don't like this program</H2>

that I=20
strongly suggested that you make backups. Constructive suggestions, =
especially=20
those with code, will be kindly treated. Flames will be deleted. I =
haven't had=20
any flames yet for this program, and I'd like to keep it that way.</P>
<H2>Where is the program going? </H2>
<P>The goal for Version 2.0 is that the program should have no bugs and =
generate=20
output compliant with official code formatting standards (and have =
options for=20
other styles). It should allow the user to configure anything that needs =
to be=20
configured, and it should not overload the user with useless =
options.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It should also have, in order of priority: readable source, an easily =

extendable and well-documented architecture, and should run fast enough. =
</P>
<H2>Can I get involved?</H2>Yes, please do. Report a bug. Request a =
feature.=20

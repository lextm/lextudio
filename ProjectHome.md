**History**

Since its birthday in May, 2005, it has served hundreds of C#Builder 1.0, Delphi 8 for .NET, Delphi 2005, and Delphi 2006 users. Because RAD Studio 2007 (including Delphi 2007 and C++Builder 2007) is built on .NET 2.0 platform, 5.x generation support and update is discontinued and here comes a new 6.0 generation, which fully takes advantage of .NET 2.0 platform.

**Notice**

  1. After installation, you can read the user manual (manual.pdf) to know more about Code Beautifier Collection and how it can improve your Delphi coding experience.
  1. Old builds of 5.x generation is still available at [old homepage](http://matrix.oss.org.cn/projects/codebeautifiers) for C#Builder/Delphi 8/2005/2006 users.

**License**

After installation, you can read the license document (license.pdf) to find the details.
